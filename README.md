# machine-learning-to-determine-whether-a-photo-is-outdoor-or-not

Project description: Determine an image was taken from outdoor or not from a dataset that has 638 photo pixel 

• Cleaned up data set using R and SAS to find the most essential variable of interests, compiled and categorized data sets using 
knowledge of a wide selection of data analytic techniques, testing against different distributions (Poisson, Exponential, and 
Gaussian) and sampling methods (random sampling and cluster sampling) to organize and classify data set so it is more 
efficient to do the secondary analysis on the data set 
• Found alternative solution for ease data representation through remodeling using Python to select data sets using Machine 
Learning techniques 
• Represent data set in Panda data visualization package and Tableau to seek for better representation of the model
